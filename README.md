# crellinor

This project is a port from Erik Doernenburg's Crellinor project (with his permission - thanks, Erik!). Our Raleigh, NC Haskell meetup group has chosen to port Erik's clojure code to Haskell for a group learning activity. Our intent it to create something similar to the original Crellinor, focusing on async functionality and using progressively more complex features of Haskell as the project matures. The end result is not defined yet, that will be decided along the way. It may become a game or a bacteria simulation or some else altogether, with the idea to have fun with the code.
